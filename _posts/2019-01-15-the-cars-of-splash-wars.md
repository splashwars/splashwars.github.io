Hello there! In this post, i would like to explain a little about the various options you'll have to play however you like.

![Splash Wars Cars](/assets/cars-01.png)

These three cars are (in order) the **Yellow Tomcat, Red Thunder and Blue Blaze**. They each represent a different role with a different playstyle:

- **Yellow Tomcat (Damage)**: This car is about speed. It has the fastest movement speed and fastest bullets, but it can't take too much punishment. It is very good when you need to spread your ink over a large region, such as a long track.
- **Red Thunder (Tank)**: This car is the best when you need to hold your ground and defend your territory. It can take a lot of damage, and blow up to pieces anyone that tries to get too close, but can't move very fast.
- **Blue Blaze (Support)**: This car is all about helping your teammates and getting yourself out of sticky situations. It has a powerful flamethower that can both damage enemies and heal allies.

# Mixing up your team

Splash Wars is a 2v2 team-based game, so your team must pick 2 out these 3 in every match. You can mix up **Damage and Tank** to quickly dispatch your enemies without losing your own painted territory, or maybe **Damage and Support** to be able to paint very quickly while healing yourself, or even **Tank and Support** to have a basically unkillable team. As a plus: *you can mix two cars of the same type*! This means you'll always be able to play with the car you prefer, and i can't wait to see the kind of damage two Yellow Tomcats can do.

# On the next post: Weapons, Special Abilities and Ultimate

Each car also has its own weapon, special ability and ultimate. I'll make a post later this week detailing each one of them, but before that, let me know what you think about our cars in our [Discord](https://invite.gg/splashwars)! I'm always there to answer your questions and feedback.

See ya!
